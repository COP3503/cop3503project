COP3503 Project
===============

This is the COP3503 project for our group. The goal is to detect and count coins in an image.

# Usage

To build the project, make a directory in the root folder called "build", then

    cd ./build
    cmake ..
    make 

Then run the file that's been created

# Using Cmake

When you create a new folder, add it in the root CMakeLists.txt, doing add_subdirectory(FOLDER NAME). Then create a CMakelists.txt file in that folder. Please look at the other folders for examples of how to do this.
