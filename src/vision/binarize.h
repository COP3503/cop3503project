/* TODOs:

    ## 
    For coin-circle similarity, fit an oval, "O" to the mask, "M".

    size(M \ O) = diff [where \ is the set difference operator]
    if diff > 0.1 * area(O): Not a coin or an oval at all!

    Notes:

        Segmentation:
            Watershed for segmentation is a reasonable approach, but will not work on complex backgrounds
            Likewise, houghcircles will fail on complex backgrounds

        
        Labelling:

            Real diameter is viewing angle insensitive
            HSV color [H] is generally lighting insensitive and always viewing angle insensitive
            -- Apply Ohtsu threshhold
            -- Full histogram matching will work better, can we do it?

            -- Note the 2D Fast Otsu method

            Perspective/affine transform of the simplest inscribing quadrilateral will give a top-down view of the coin
            -- Then, can use Haar cascade
